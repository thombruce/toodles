#### Interactive Tags

These interactive tags work with the Toodles desktop app:

##### Count

```toodles
count:12
```

##### Time

```toodles
time:1h33m
```

##### Every

_The every tag will generate a new todo when the current one is checked off. It will determine the new date based on either the due date, if present, the created date or the current date. In the Toodles app, the newly generated todo will have a created and new due date added automatically._

```toodles
~ daily
every:Day
~ every 3 days starting from due date, created date or today
every:3days
~ weekly
every:Week
~ every 3 weeks starting from due date, created date or today
every:3weeks
~ alias for every:2weeks
every:Fortnight
~ monthly
every:Month
~ every 3 months starting from due date, created date or today
every:3months
~ yearly
every:Year

every:Thursday
~ every Monday, Wednesday and Friday starting from due date, created date or today
every:Monday,Wednesday,Friday
~ alias for every:Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday
every:Weekday
```

## Multiplier

The multiplier appears at the end of your todo. _It is only valid if a price or price range is present._

```toodles
£1.50 This todo has a price and a multiplier x3
```

## Nesting

Todos can be padded with four spaces to indicate that they belong to a non-nested todo above.

```toodles
Spring cleaning
    Clear gutters

```
