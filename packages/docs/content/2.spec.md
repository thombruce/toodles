## The Original Todo.txt Spec

Todo.txt is a text-based todo list format originally created by Lifehacker founder, Gina Trapani. She still maintains the [todotxt.org](http://todotxt.org) website, which lists dozens of applications for managing Todo.txt files.

### Open Todo

```todotxt
(A) 2016-05-20 2016-04-30 measure space for +chapelShelving @chapel due:2016-05-30
```

### Completed Todo

```todotxt
x (A) 2016-05-20 2016-04-30 measure space for +chapelShelving @chapel due:2016-05-30
```

## Toodles: The Extended Spec

Toodles supports all of the features present in the Todo.txt examples above while defining several new features of its own.

These features come in different flavours. There are those that are lifted straight from Todo.txt, those that are new to Toodles but do not break compatibility with Todo.txt, those that are new to Toodles and which do break compatibility (marked as Todo.txt incompatible below) and those that fall into a "non-strict" scope which are incompatible with the Todo.txt spec and also break some of its quality of life features like alphabetized sorting.

> NOTE: These flavours may be better named in the future as [Compatible]{class="text-success"}, [Strict]{class="text-warning"} and [Full]{class="text-danger"}; where [Compatible]{class="text-success"} features are those that will work with most clients built to the Todo.txt spec, [Strict]{class="text-warning"} features are those which are incompatible but maintain the spirit of and quality of life features of the Todo.txt spec, and [Full]{class="text-danger"} features are those which deviate from the spec entirely and require more sophisticated tools to be worked with. It is possible to mix features such that your own usage fits none of these specs and is instead [Mixed]{class="text-pink-500"}.

## Subtasks/Nesting (Toodles - non-strict - Experimental)

_Marked as non-strict due to the effects this has on sorting. Nested lists require a more advanced sorting algorithm._

```toodles
Spring cleaning
    Clear gutters
    Paint upstairs bathroom
```

## State

### Done (Todo.txt)

```toodles
x Done
```

### Focus (Toodles - Todo.txt incompatible)

```toodles
! The focus modifier highlights a task in bold; it will sort to the top of your list
```

### Obsolete (Toodles - Todo.txt incompatible)

```toodles
~ Useful for adding notes
```

### Padded (Toodles - non-strict)

_Marked as non-strict due to the effects this has on sorting; as a general rule, just don't mix padded and unpadded list items in the same document._

```toodles
- Same as a standard list item; use if you want alignment with done/obsolete tasks
```

## Priority (Todo.txt)

```toodles
(A) Most important
(B) Important
(C) Less important
Least important
```

_The every tag will generate a new todo when the current one is checked off. It will determine the new date based on either the due date, if present, the created date or the current date. In the Toodles app, the newly generated todo will have a created and new due date added automatically._
